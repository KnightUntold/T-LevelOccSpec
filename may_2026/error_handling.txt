Error handling

L - Logs
E - Error Message
A - Area
D - Doublecheck
S – Scrutinise

Logs – look for evidence

php
    • error logs (control panel)

Javascript
    • console logs

Liquid
    • on save/terminal

Ajax
    • Network tab

Error Message – what does it say?
    • Read the error message
        ◦ line number
        ◦ file name
        ◦ what went wrong
    • stack trace
    • inspector tab

    • put it into google (remove code details)
    • go through it in text editor (make it more readable)
Area – go to the area referred in the code
    • spelling mistakes
    • missing: ; {} () (punctuation)
    • variables
        ◦ Names
        ◦ overwriting
        ◦ scope
google with parse
tab your code
be mindful of common variable names

Doublecheck – Is your code doing what it should?
    • Log it out
        ◦ console.log()
        ◦ echo
        ◦ var_dump
        ◦ echo “<pre>” print_r($array, true) “<pre>”; (this is for arrays)
        ◦ {{}}
        ◦ mail()
    • location
    • breakpoints
	stops the code running at that point
    • google (source tab)


Scrutinise – go through the code in more detail
    • comment out everything then uncomment chunk by chunk
    • go back to the basics
        ◦ is it the right file?
        ◦ Has your file uploaded to the server correctly?
        ◦ Revert to when it last worked and write it out again
        ◦ cache
